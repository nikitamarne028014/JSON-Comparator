# JSON-Comparator

Json-Comparator is a java code to compare 2 json schema's that are of same type but different structures. i.e 1 is flat Json and other is nested json.
The purpose of this comparator is to check if both the schema's are similar or not and to list down the differences between them very easily.
In this code when you import the project you need to change the file locations to the file locations of your own local machine. 

there are 3 files present in the code
1. Old.Json (this file contains Old json schema)
2. New.Json (this file contains New json schema)
3. Comparision output. (This file will give the detail report of the comparision between 2 json files. The result of the comparision is written in this file)
